# Running a Container with Azure ACR Tasks (Without Docker Installed)

Your manager has asked you to run a container — but there’s a problem:  
you don't have Docker installed on your local machine.

Fortunately, Azure offers a great solution. With **ACR Tasks** built directly into **Azure Cloud Shell**, you can build, push, and run containers entirely in the cloud without installing Docker locally.

## 🎯 Goal

Create a new **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** and use **ACR Tasks** to:

1. **Build** the container  
2. **Push** the image to ACR  
3. **Run** the container in Azure

All from Azure Cloud Shell, with no local Docker installation required.
