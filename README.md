# Azure-labs

This repository will serve as my documentation section for any Azure labs that I complete.

## Free Azure Account

I created a Azure subscription with the free $200 credit that Azure provides to help "get you started" working with Azure resources. 

## Azure Budget 

I created an Azure budget (See below) and set up some alerts so I know when I am coming up on the $200 credit.

## 1. Administer Identity
- [X] **Lab 01:** Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

This lab was pretty simple as it incorporates skills that I preform daily. I essentially was tasked with creating a normal cloud user along with inviting an external user to my tenant. Lastly, I created a group with both the user that I created.

## 2. Administer Governance and Compliance
- [X] **Lab 02a:** Manage Subscriptions and RBAC
      In this lab I learned more about Subscriptions/Management Groups. I learned that Subscriptions are used as silos to differentiate spending. Management groups are used as containers to organize those subscriptions and subsequent resource groups/resoureces. I also created custom RBAC role and assigned it to my IT Lab Admins group inside my Management Group.
